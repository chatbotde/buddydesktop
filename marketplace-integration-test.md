# Marketplace Integration - Instant Dropdown Updates

## Overview
This implementation provides instant dropdown updates when items are added from the marketplace. The changes are immediately reflected in the main application dropdown and stored locally.

## Key Features

### 1. **Instant Updates**
- When you click on any item in the marketplace, it's instantly added/removed from the main dropdown
- No need to click "Apply Changes" to see the effect in the main application
- Real-time synchronization between marketplace window and main application

### 2. **Local Storage**
- All changes are automatically saved to localStorage with the key `buddy-custom-menu-buttons`
- Data persists across application restarts
- Fallback to default buttons if localStorage is corrupted

### 3. **Dual Storage Keys**
- Uses both `customMenuButtons` and `buddy-custom-menu-buttons` for compatibility
- Ensures marketplace and main application use the same data source

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
User clicks marketplace item
    ↓
toggleButton() called
    ↓
Save to localStorage immediately
    ↓
notifyMainWindowInstantly() called
    ↓
Send IPC 'marketplace-instant-update'
    ↓
Main process receives and forwards to renderer
    ↓
_handleMarketplaceButtonsUpdated() called
    ↓
Update customMenuButtons property
    ↓
Force re-render header component
    ↓
Dropdown updated instantly!
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **marketplace-integration.js**
   - Enhanced `_handleMarketplaceButtonsUpdated()` to force header updates
   - Added support for `marketplace-instant-update` IPC events

2. **marketplace.html**
   - Added `notifyMainWindowInstantly()` function
   - Modified `toggleButton()` to call instant notifications
   - Immediate localStorage save on every change

3. **marketplace-handlers.js**
   - Added handler for `marketplace-instant-update` IPC event
   - Forwards instant updates to main window

4. **buddy-header.js**
   - Added `_loadCustomMenuButtonsFromLocalStorage()` method
   - Initialize customMenuButtons from localStorage on construction
   - Always reload from localStorage in `_getMenuButtonsData()`

5. **StateManagementMixin.js**
   - Updated initialization to use localStorage with proper key
   - Added `_loadCustomMenuButtonsFromLocalStorage()` method

## Testing the Feature

### Test Steps
1. **Open Marketplace**
   - Click the three dots menu in header → "Marketplace"

2. **Test Instant Updates**
   - Click on any button in marketplace to add/remove it
   - Check main application dropdown immediately
   - The item should appear/disappear instantly without clicking "Apply"

3. **Test Persistence**
   - Add some items through marketplace
   - Close and restart the application
   - Check that your changes are still there

4. **Test Multiple Changes**
   - Rapidly add/remove multiple items
   - Each change should be reflected instantly

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Immediate dropdown updates (no delay)
- ✅ localStorage saves automatically
- ✅ Changes persist after restart
- ✅ Works in both Electron and browser environments
- ✅ Header component re-renders dynamically

## Browser Console Debugging

You can monitor the functionality using browser console:

```javascript
// Check current saved buttons
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('buddy-custom-menu-buttons'))

// Manually set buttons for testing
localStorage.setItem('buddy-custom-menu-buttons', JSON.stringify(['chat', 'history', 'audio-window']))

// Check if events are firing (in marketplace window)
window.notifyMainWindowInstantly(['test', 'buttons'])
```

## Troubleshooting

### If instant updates don't work:
1. Check console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
3. Ensure IPC handlers are registered in main process

### If changes don't persist:
1. Check localStorage permissions
2. Verify the key `buddy-custom-menu-buttons` is being used
3. Check for localStorage quota issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Visual feedback when items are added (animations, notifications)
- Undo/redo functionality for marketplace changes
- Bulk select/deselect options
- Categories and filtering in marketplace
- Import/export button configurations

## Notes

- The "Apply Changes" button still works as before for final confirmation
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Backward compatibility maintained with old storage keys
- Works with both authenticated and guest users
