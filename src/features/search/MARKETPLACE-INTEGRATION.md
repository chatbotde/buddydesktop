## Added Marketplace Items

- **ID**: `search-window`
- **Name**: Search Window

- **Description**: Open dedicated search window for files and content
- **Icon**: Search magnifying glass icon

### 2. Search Toggle Button

## How to Use

### Adding Search to Menu via Marketplace
1. Open the main menu (â˜° button)
2. Select "Marketplace" 
3. Search for "search" or browse the "Tools" category
4. Check the boxes for "Search Window" and/or "Search Toggle"
5. Click "Apply Changes"

### Using Search Features
- **Search Window**: Opens a dedicated floating search window for file and content search
- **Search Toggle**: Enables/disables search functionality (shows active status)

## Integration Points

### Files Modified
1. **marketplace-window.js**: Added search buttons to available buttons arrays
2. **buddy-element.js**: Added search event handlers and methods
3. **index.js**: Added IPC handler for search window creation
4. **buddy-header.js**: Already included search functionality

### Event Handling
- `toggle-search`: Toggles search functionality state
- `open-search-window`: Opens the dedicated search window

### IPC Communication
- `create-search-window`: Main process handler for creating search windows

## Search Window Features
When opened through marketplace selection:
- Floating, draggable window
- File and content search capabilities
- Real-time search with filters
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Expandable results view
- Search history and caching

## Technical Implementation
The search features follow the same architectural pattern as existing features (audio window, etc.):
- Event-driven communication between components
- IPC-based window creation and management
- State management through BuddyElement
- Theme and styling consistency

Users can now customize their workflow by adding search capabilities directly through the marketplace interface!
